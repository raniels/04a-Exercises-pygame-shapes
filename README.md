# 04a-Exercises-pygame-shapes

I installed pygame to complete the following excercises. I found them pretty straightforward excep excericse 2 where I ran into some issues because I deleted some of the defined variables at the beginning since I was using random.randint() to generate random values and didn't know that you had to use double parentheses for color. Other than that I was able to succesfully complete the excercises using knowledge we had to learn from class. Excercise 1 we kind of did in class together when we had time left. Excercise 2 I have already spoken about. Excercise 3 was converting the value provided to a string so that it could be displayed. Excercise 4 was simply setting the x,y = t pos, the variable assigned to the location where the mouse button is released.
